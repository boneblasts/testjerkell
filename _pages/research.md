# Research

We belive that better understanding of the brain could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. Since rapid progress has been made in the related fields of the neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to investigate the critical and ongoing importance of neuroscience in generating ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research. Thus, we seek to narrow the gap between neuroscience and AI by understanding both research fields. Our lab is interested in the follwing research areas but not limited.

  The brain provides a rich source of inspiration for new types of algorithms and architectures of artificial intelligence (AI) and can provide validation of AI techniques that already exist. If a known algorithm is subsequently found to be implemented in the brain, then that is strong support for its plausibility as an integral component of an overall general intelligence system. Our view is that leveraging in-sights gained from neuroscience research will expedite progress in AI research. As convolutional neural networks are inspired by the vision system in the brain, understanding brain functions is a key for developing novel deep learning models. We study neuroscience to understand the brain and develop brain-like neural networks based on how the brain works.

  Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. For these reasons, devloping novel techniques using deel learning to understand complex natural language has become widespread and gained attention for computer scientists. We study state-of-the-art deep learning models and seek to develop novel natural language deep learning models. 
  
 - Neurophysiological Signal Processing ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eeg.png){: style="width: 400px; float: right"} 
 
   Neurophysiology is a research filed of studying the functional properties of neurons, glia, and networks. Electrophysiology, refers to the electrical recording of neuronal events ranging from the molar (electroencephalogram, EEG) to the cellular (intracellular recording of the properties of single neurons), is one of the primary research areas in neurophysiology. To understand these neurophysiological and electrophysiological signals, modern digital signal processing techniques including the traditional basics of signal processing are needed. We study state-of-the-art signal processing techniques to analyze neurophysiological signals from the brain and use our techniques to help various fields such as dianosis of psychiatric diseases.
